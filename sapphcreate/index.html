        <h1>Nebulae</h1>
        <p>Nebulae are clouds of dust and gas that have gathered under gravity, but they're not quite dense enough for stars to form yet. Eventually, these gases will collapse together, and a star will commence its formation. Until then, the gases stick together in nebulous clouds, hence the name. A nebula was intially used to describe anything in outer space that was not tightly packed together, and so at the time, galaxies beyond our own were called nebulae. </p>
        <p>Now, nebulae only refers to clouds of helium, hydrogen, and other gases. Typically, the gaseous nebulae are the only ones you'll be able to see with the naked eye. Planetary nebulae are shells of gas surrounding remnants of old stars. Gaseous Nebulae are related and correspond with the birth of stars. While on the other hand, planetary nebulae are related to and correspond towards the end of a star's life. Planetary Nebulae appear after a red giant star has shrunk and has become a white dwarf. They got this name because, through a telescope, they appear like a glowing disk which looks similar to a planet. Another thing to note is that towards a star's life, depending on it's size, they either go supernova then turn into a black hole or neutron star, Or they fade away gently into a white dwarf with a planetary nebula and eventually they turn into a black dwarf.</p>
