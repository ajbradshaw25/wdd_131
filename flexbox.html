            <p>Another common layout task for Flexbox is to control the format of blocks of content consisting of text and images that often need to shift based on the size of the screen. The behavior we want is for the image to be to the side of the text when there is enough room on wider screens, and the image to stack above the text on narrower screens.</p>
